Given two equal length strings representing two players' strategies for a game, return the scores as an array `[player1, player2]`.
- The given strings will only contain one of two letters: `"C"` (cooperate) or `"D"` (defect).
- Each character represents one round, scored as follows:
  - If both players cooperate, each scores 3.
  - If both players defect, each scores 1.
  - If one player defects and the other cooperates, the defector scores 5 and the cooperator scores 0.

**Tests:**
1. `playGame("CCCC", "CCCC")` should return `[12, 12]`.
2. `playGame("DDDD", "DDDD")` should return `[4, 4]`.
3. `playGame("CCDD", "CDDD")` should return `[5, 10]`.
4. `playGame("CCCDCDCCCDDC", "CCDDCDCDDCCD")` should return `[24, 34]`.
5. `playGame("DDCCDDDDCDDCDDDCDD", "CCDCCCDCCCDCCCCDCC")` should return `[66, 21]`.
