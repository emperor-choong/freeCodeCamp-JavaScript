# Between Two Buckets

Given two buckets of paint, each with an RGB color and a fullness level, return the mixed RGB color as an array of three integers.
- Each bucket is an object (JavaScript) or dictionary (Python) with a `color` property (an array of three integers `[r, g, b]`) and a `fullness property` (0–100).
- The mixed color is a weighted average of each channel in the two colors based on fullness level, with each channel rounded to the nearest integer.

**Tests:**
1. `mixPaint({ color: [250, 250, 250], fullness: 50 }, { color: [0, 0, 0], fullness: 50 })` should return `[125, 125, 125]`.
2. `mixPaint({ color: [250, 250, 250], fullness: 80 }, { color: [0, 0, 0], fullness: 20 })` should return `[200, 200, 200]`.
3. `mixPaint({ color: [100, 150, 200], fullness: 30 }, { color: [100, 150, 200], fullness: 70 })` should return `[100, 150, 200]`.
4. `mixPaint({ color: [143, 143, 101], fullness: 45 }, { color: [100, 204, 204], fullness: 90 })` should return `[114, 184, 170]`.
5. `mixPaint({ color: [15, 134, 249], fullness: 29 }, { color: [97, 178, 55], fullness: 54 })` should return `[68, 163, 123]`.
