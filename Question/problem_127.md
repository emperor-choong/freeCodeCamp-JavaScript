# Circular Prime  
## [9 January 2026]

Given an integer, determine if it is a circular prime.

A circular prime is an integer where all rotations of its digits are themselves prime.

For example, `197` is a circular prime because all rotations of its digits: `197`, `971`, and `719`, are prime numbers.

**Tests**
1. `isCircularPrime(197)` should return `true`.
2. `isCircularPrime(23)` should return `false`.
3. `isCircularPrime(13)` should return `true`.
4. `isCircularPrime(89)` should return `false`.
5. `isCircularPrime(1193)` should return `true`.
